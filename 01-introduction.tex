\section{INTRODUCTION}
Introduction following keywords should include problem background, a literature review of recent papers published in journals, which clearly shows what is the not yet solved aspect of the problem, followed by the hypothesis that would settle the issue. The section should clearly distinguish any gap that may be addressed in comparison to previously published research and represent the aims of the research work. It would be very useful if authors thoroughly reviewed papers that have been already published in partner journals in special issues dedicated to the SDEWES conference series. Such an effort would not only improve the quality of the manuscript but also promote awareness of the available knowledge resources that exist in the structure of the SDEWES conference series. Please consider including the online database for the literature review: http://www.sdewes.org/journals.php.
